so I hope you guys can see and you know maybe I can start right off yeah cool okay so what I did is I made a series of like your own age of mine slaves mostly because you know I have already done short sort of a male trade on the remote Indian slag so I just wanted some you know different content otherwise it will just be rehashing the same things so a bit about me to start so I have around 10 years or 15 years experience programming my first job was at this company called SlideShare I was one of the first engineers there so it was
interesting to work in a product company in India right out of college I was part of that and I you know found it a few startups as well I've mostly been working in startups honestly as part of my career I'm currently kind of very interested in front-end stuff I've done a lot of back-end work as well but mostly right now react and functional programming and stuff you know seems very interesting I joined doest just would four days back so you know I'm still in week one so I'm not sure how much of detail I'll be able
to give you you know very honestly about duyst but you know I will try my best and I am on the you sides-- so I'm on Twitter I'm on github and I have a blog as well which is all mainly yeah so so these are the four topics today total discovered quickly so one is figuring out what you want and making a plan to get there a few details of my personal journey which I'll you know it sort of interspersed in between one and two and some details of the interview process which are mostly pieces opening on the
older thread and I just walk you over the questions and answers that I got previously just for people who you know then take a look at the thread earlier so yeah so let's start with figuring on what you want right so this is going to be slightly different from what you probably expected so this is not a recipe for you know getting a job at doing store getting a job at any of the other you know good remote companies because I sort of believe that you know to to sort of get what you want you have to change yourself as well or
either you have to figure out what is it that you what is it that you exactly want right so so this is a good manifesto so this is available as a poster I actually have it always so it was very inspirational honestly when I first started off so so one of the things is one of the things that's sort of visible here in respectable job is now if you don't like your job quit I'm not really going to talk about that I'm mostly going to talk about you know the other theme here which is you know do what you love then do it off it so I
sort of believe that you know the things that you really want to have will be waiting for you when you start doing the things that you about right so how do you kind of figure out what is it the other things that you love so this is a really nice book it has got a very sort of gamification title I wished it had a different but you know but it's a good book it's called 18 steps to own your life it sort of condensed wisdom from a bunch of other self-help books and one of the initial steps talks about this
exercise which I personally found very useful to figure out what is it that I want out of my life right what is it that I love doing and so on so figuring on what you want that says goes like this so you have to write down take a you know maybe a half an hour and write down five answers to each one of these questions so what do you want more off in your life what do you want less self in your life what excites you the most what are you most proud of main three people you admired and let's create tips for why you admire each person
describe your ideal day if money was not an issue how would you spend your time and what do you want to be remembered as right so you see kind of think about these questions and you sort of know write down these answers and once you write down these answers you sort of group the answers into value teams because what will emerge out of these answers is you know most of them will be repetitive and when you can group these into value teams you know you might have more than three value teams because you know as a person you might be interested
in a bunch of things you pick the top three the top three that you know occur is a move it's toward top three that you think are the most important and then you sort of you know structure your life around the top three right so so these sort of examples of my answers you know yours would be you know very different right so like example for this question what do you want to be remembered as you know I I don't I want to be a good engineer I want to have some attention to detail and I want to have a design
sense you know I wanted to be known as somebody who has built great thoughtful products right I want also to be known as somebody who is kind caring impatient as somebody who people would like to spend time with and so on so so these were sort of like so as you can see it's a mix of both personal and professional stuff it's not entirely you know this is what I want out of my work it's also this is what I this is the kind of person that I want to be right so it's a mix of you know these two things and
once you have you know a bunch of these enhancers group together you can sort of figure out your bag of things right so so people might leave anything but I want it to be a builder of useful thoughtful and meaningful products I wanted to be recognized as a good engineer great attention to detail and I wanted to get more log and care in my life right so so these were the sort of themes that emerged for me personally right so again you know you we'll be different at each stage of your life also this would be different right
so if I was writing this ten years ago I would have very different things to right here so so it's a good exercise though to to kind of figure out you know what is it that you love doing and I would sort of encourage all of you to know to start thinking about this the second bit is you know once you've figured out what what is it that you love doing you need to make a plan to get there right so in this specific case obviously we're talking about work and the new job so you know how do you kind of analyze you know what is it that you
love and then how do you get to a job that you love right so the first theme obviously is new value themes three value teams that I mentioned earlier sort of they drive every decision it's important that they drive evolution because you know that's what you wrote down least as forth right and this decision which is the kind of company that you want to work at should also be driven by a value teams so this is what I personally wrote down your jaw's would be influenced by your value things vary but I don't things like you know I want
you to work in a product company because in my experience services or software consultancy companies didn't really have an emphasis on products that I really you know like building because I wanted to build products and I wanted to work in a bootstrap or a public company because you know I I sort of felt that you know at least from my experience a lot of venture backup means this you know go after growth they don't really go after building a good product and I want to build a profitable company because again you know I don't want to
be stuck in the early stages where I know we still trying to figure out know what to build I've done that enough and more in my life so I want you to know work in a company that is kind of figure it out it has a profitable engine and I wanted to grow the product and I want to be powerful meaningful product there was always a salary and then you know the fact that was removed so that was simply because you know I had a good experience working they would in my previous job for on seven months I was removed and that was
a good experience for me and I sort of checked off promoted and open so simply because no I use a lot of open source tools and you know it would be nice to work in a company that has a lot of open source stuff interviews because you know I'm too old to actually like go through whiteboarding interviews again I probably forgotten how the computer science that I've learned if I have learned you know anything so something which focuses on my actual tasks in a job would be interesting and then balance pickles you know my third
objective is I want no more love and care in my life so you know for that I need simple at some time and a complete a test expert some time was also important right so so this is the sort of criteria that I wrote down there is an interesting site that Swann and posted in the channel recently so it will people first jobs so if I was starting today I would probably like to start with these companies because you know they seem to have most of the tight area that I that I let's still you know I had a few extra ones as well that
doesn't really matter but for me you know this would have been a pretty good place to at least start so there's a bunch of amines here who are looking for good people and they they seem to have no respect for their people as well so so you can start here and yeah so that's that's my second section and then there's a bunch of details of my interview process I don't really do is I just think over the thread which I which I had here so so I got asked a bunch of questions you know so what was my role
at whilst it was a fact developer role there were four rounds of interviews you know it was it was an interesting interview process because it's entirely remote and there was the first sound initially with a front end lead then it was a take-home task and then there was a call to sort of you know talk about my submission and then there was a final call with the CTO so I think it took me around six weeks from beginning to end the task took around a week or so so then there was some questions about what exactly my task was
so I have a reports tree here which care it's also there in the channel which is very similar to what would be actually task is so if you just want to understand the complexity of the task I think you know this was a good benchmark obviously the task keeps changing so it wouldn't you know probably going to be pretty much the same so I did freshers in my team I think I can answer that right now I don't think that up freshers but almost everybody is younger than me so you know since you don't really need
to have my kind of experience 15 years or something to to get introduced so the cover letter yeah so I shared my sort of application you know why are you interested in working in twist the carrier highlights and so on and so forth right so so again you know I try as much as possible to openness to to who I am so I think that's what you should do as well sometimes what happens this you know you kind of inflate stuff in your travel lighter or in your application and you know that's probably something that's very easy to find
and you know you really don't want that because I know you you want to work in a company where you're true to yourself so yeah this is right start which it seemed sensible I have one more pointer here which is called write it like a human which I didn't post and me you know resources so there was also some questions are going to tax structure I'm going to be the best person to up and so bad but the waist-high as individual contractors so it's almost like a direct pay out to my account I haven't yet received my first salary
so I'm not exactly sure how that works right suppose for the person that came in earlier and I'm actually done with my you know presentation I just have a couple more slides so yeah I mean whatever I've shared in oh please don't copy paste it's it's it's a purpose it'll be true to yourself which I put down so write like a human is I think one of the simple things which you guys you can learn to sort of improve your writing because if you want to get into a remote company most of the time you're
not really having one-on-one conversation people you are actually writing down stuff it and improving your writing is very important so so one of the things is like example let go of the shiny mask of perfection you don't really need to write or fix stuff right you need to write like a human and humans are imperfect humans are not funny and humans make mistakes in stuff right so in some senses it's it's nice to be built article like I sort of think about a bunch of things there as well a key guy is one of the one of the things
which philosophy is which has influenced me personally so it's a bunch of things which kind of figure out what you are if you're interested in the second so read that more so I do the sections is called morning pagelings every day and I sort of believe that even one of the reasons why I sort of take taking a few decisions in my life which you know I have to take so because you know when you start you know it's very easy to be stuck in a rut sometimes right so it's very easy to wake up every day and look in the mirror
and not be happy with who you are still continue to live life that way so morning clearance is one of those exercises which will help you kind of get out of the broth so it's interesting you know take a look at this and then there is obviously deep work which is you know in any kind of creative work where you you know intensely focus on something and programming is sort of like that you really need to find some sort of structure in which to work so deep work is a very good book to sort of read and understand how to get blocks of
trying for yourself so that you're able to be productive so yep that's it for me and I should now take questions here this was really I think helpful because it sets like the context for the rest of the session I think you know this is much more you know like than just giving an intro where you know I feel that you know this kind of gives an idea about the experience that you have and you know things that you have big things that you have thought of I would say like it's very important if I can you
know add that very important to think about the why a lot of people do not devote enough time and that is where there is a conflict arises and so I guess this was the reversing make you give us questions instead of you know so I think if you submission you can see my screen is like a leash on your screen it's so other questions visible like the pages no I can I can see the Google slides like okay just invisible yeah yeah so I can you want me to take it from the top the tree Iowa yeah yeah I think we just you know let your
audience know that you know like they can post the questions here or if they're not comfortable they can also post it in the chat window because this might be you know like if people are not able to figure you know how this you know thing works and yeah I'll keep the screen open so that everyone has like an idea about which questions are being discussed and so yeah I think let's you know start off with the first one and this is a question which you know like this cupcake is a question that I I have
you know and I feel you know like you can provide some context to this as in like you have been part of so many early stage age you know startups so was that you know I thought that you know why don't I start the bootstrap company myself like why did you specifically focus on engineering you know let's say 14 so I did start a company you know with the couple of friends and if he lies I'm not really you know wired to be like a founder so the company was company is still live by the way so I personally left the company it's still
doing good so the company is called startup village the domain is SV dog Co and it's actually quite doing quite well but so I personally I'm not really found the material so it's a bunch more uncertainty than you know I personally what in my life but yeah so but working for a starter is different because you know you you're valued for for your skills and for who you are and you don't really like a cog in the wheel so in that sense it's very useful to to work in startups so if you if you're young and if you have an
option between startups and a called pretty career you know I would actually say prefer a starter because you learn a lot more there and when you're young you sort of have to prioritize learning over earning right so so in that sense yeah I did start a company and I realized I have an order but yeah at some point of time I I do want to probably try my hand again in the niche that you mentioned which is you know bootstrapped ventures right so I think part of the reason why I joined twist you know you know I could have
joined a similar company like that is because that skill is very difficult to find in India we don't I can't just trying to because it's not just engineering right because I think all of those good engineers and we want to build and we know how to build products but it's also marketing in you know finding a nation finding an audience installs and that's that's very different so yeah learning that would be nice as well and was this you know like something like which came about because of you know
your journaling in the morning pages that you think you know was this part you know like kind of were you very sure you know at the start of your career that you know oh yes yes it revolves to like you know to the morning tea spoon you know it's not something which gives you direct answers so the person who wrote it Julia I think you know she is very spiritual in the sense she she sort of things of it as you know the words from God I am NOT a spiritual person but you know at the same time you know it's in something that you know sort of
probably can be thought of as they were your thoughts which come up in the morning unfiltered odds which come out in the morning right so so in that sense sometimes some days you're feeling good about things and you you write down good things some days you're feeling you know bad about things new right or you know really bad stuff so there is a lot of exciting and but at some point of time you realize there is a trend and you follow the trend and probably good things will happen to you right so so the next question that is you know like
you might have you know converted in some you know way in the slides but like what advice would you would you give to someone who is out there looking for obviously this is like a very broad question and it would be you know very difficult to answer this but yeah maybe you can you know take a stab at it yeah so you know let's start with the why like what Abbey Sheikh was saying right so definitely figure out what is it that you want how to promote and Sean because there are so many different kinds of remote companies as well right
now you know a lot of companies are turning remote because of the Corolla situation right so the options are much broader than what it was a year ago so so in that sense you know figure out what niche that you want even inside the remote and then you know build your broad skills it so figure out what is it that you're good at so I like to think of people as sort of t-shaped individuals so you have a broad base of skill so you're sort of like a jack-of-all-trades and you're a master of one right so that one can be anything
right so it can be you know in my case it's it's probably programming but you know it could be marketing it could be sales it could be content writing so I think a lot of started we're looking for people who also have a bunch of non technical requirements as well so in that sense I think you know figure out your niche start applying and you will get there but start with the Y if possible it would take like half an hour to kind of go through the exercise that I mentioned a lot of people kind of jump into action without thinking about
the way it's it's probably not a wise thing to do simply because you know you really need to think about the Y sometimes and that will help you don't line yeah I think if we want we can dig deeper into that question in a follow-up question if required but I kind of move to the next question which is how was your experience working in in your last company which is Lucilius and why did you want to you know switch jobs yeah you see business is a brilliant company I think I I would still document you
know if you are a fresher especially in order to work in the company like los sitios they one of the few companies in India working in the security space and doing some pretty amazing stuff right so I was at Lockheed is for a year and a half almost and you know we did some pretty cool stuff there so they have a protocol safe which does security quantification so yeah it was a nice experience and you know it was it was good working you know for them for the product so it was a nice experience the reason why I left presently because you
know they didn't match any of the criteria which I mentioned earlier and I did wise that's what I wanted out of my life so it just so happens that you know it might be a good opportunity but the opportunity might not be the best thing for you right for you personally so so as an adult you just take the decision that you know you want to leave even thing you know you smooth the process forward if you do it with respect and you know you make sure that your relationships at the company are not you know destroy it
in any way give them adequate notice and make sure that it's it's done properly right so in that sense I know you were still friends with all of those people so say I mean there's nothing bad about Lucy days that I left the company it says that I wanted something a field it can make sense yeah I think you thought you know bring up an important point doesn't it even when you're leaving companies as in just because you haven't had let's say a face-to-face relationship with your employers and
doesn't mean that you know you shouldn't be human about this process obviously you know it works both ways like employees also have to you know be very mindful about how they treat their employees but as for us also when we are you know leaving companies or switching companies I think it's important that we leave it in the right space we don't misuse that trust otherwise that's something you know like the ecosystem is still very young like you know people are still figuring out how to create
trust in this remote work so I think we can do a bit and make sure that at least from our end we are not breaking the contract human contract yeah so I think yeah especially in remote companies it will be more challenging because you know there is this problem with communication right so most of the time you're not face-to-face and you know do we you know see the other person and human cues and stuff right the other thing which I personally try to do was over communicate so just write down things a lot more than I usually would
document a lot more things and sometimes helps so moving on to the next question my understanding is like what is what was your process to you know get an interview for this particular company and maybe you can you know to share your experience how are you you know went about applying for loosing yes I think that would also give people some you know context also yeah so this is the interview I didn't single saw their job posting and I applied and I caught in to be recorded so so in that sense it was a very short process but you said
you made a list of company yes yes I have a list of alone seven or eight companies honestly I can maybe read them out here let me just write find that so yeah so I made a list a bunch of companies lbs was one of the companies automatic which is WordPress that was doest elastic Griffin paper pile sticker mule wet flow module scruffy and then ghost buffers late your clothes don't go I can probably like you know maybe paste it in charge here if that makes sense we have actually one person who's working
the Furnham okay so this was sort of the this is probably outdated because I did this maybe like three or four months ago but this was a list that I need and I think I at lied to to top code I just started my application so in that case in flash me that was kind of lucky my sense do is to call me back pretty early so I think I'd like to have a staff need me and to do is we should I didn't apply to automatic foot yeah so but there was a bunch of companies like this which I kind of found out and you know started applying so yeah I think
you just have to do the work right so I mean so for Lucilius for example you know I got the job because I had a friend working there so it was a rational sort of thing but with remote companies it's likely harder because you know in India especially those it's still taking off so you don't have bad films and your friends working in the world companies and stuff so I think if there's a chance for you to get a bathroom that's probably the best thing because that rules are handled very differently
usually in my experience in every company because when somebody that was you know so they sort of think that you know that person is automatically good and you don't skip any steps but you know you still get pushed to the top of the interviewee mostly so if a red film is possible I think that would be a test but if not you know start applying and be true to yourself and every one of the application and you know battle battle just solving yeah I think you know that's pretty helpful moving on to the next question
how are salary negotiations you know this is putting you on the spot but fixed salary for every role so I think we have a salary calculator I'm not sure it's public it's probably not public but they have you know salary calculator so if you're aware of the gitlab salary calculator it I it probably works very similarly I honestly haven't seen their salary calculator but you know I always made aware that the thing is there and yeah I can place a link to the day plug one here so you guys simply to
look in how that works so yeah so so the fixed salary it would have a role and there is no negotiation so it's either like you know sort of take it or leave it and so if this will happen that you know my ex slacks for you sort of melt was meant and I sort of took the rule and Delta is location-based so it is indexed most remote companies most good remote companies do that so so in India I would get paid X in the US I'm gonna take paid to X or whatever right so say the pay is location-based I think I would say like
if you are applying for companies global companies I think that doesn't you know generally they become a hurdle in it's only when you know like when you are applying for Indian companies I would say that's where there is a little bit of like Leslie where but say anyway something like moving on to more interesting questions which is this more like a like a life hack how do you maintain your you know energy while working from home is there like like some kind of rituals that you have I think kind of relates to the next
question as well feel free to sure so yeah I do have the morning you know it is routine which I talked about it's every day I wake up I wake up at around 6:30 and I spend you know around it takes around 45 minutes for me to write three pages it's it's pros that you write basically using a pen and paper Holtz titled I rewrite it takes around 45 minutes for me to write three pages so that's almost the first thing that I do and then I I do like around 20 minutes of yoga which is it's mostly
just Surya Namaskar no that's the only thing I really know how to do so I just do a bunch of them and then I wash my dishes and I take a shower and I start working I worked mostly from around 9 to 5:30 or so some days I work slightly late if I feel like it but after that I just cook something for the night and then I read a bit and then I go to sleep so it's kind of boring schedule so that's and I don't know exactly how I maintain my energy so it's it's stupid it's difficult obviously like when the corona
situation is completely go out of the house so I used to go to the gym and stuff but now that's all that has been stopped and some weeks are definitely bad so this week was even though I was supposed to be like we get cited because it doest and all that somehow my energy levels were you know low so so there is a good book by the way it's called the obstructing is the way the obstacle is away it's yeah yeah so it's it's a nice book because you know it sort of kind of talks about how most of the time you
know what we perceive as difficulties or usually opportunities so it's I'm still trying to understand the book and the philosophy and so on but what I'm trying to sort of see the good things in my situation so for example because I had a bunch of time you know I sort of rejuvenate my blog I've been writing my blog since a long time but for the past few years it's mostly being like modern too poor so yeah so this theory I sort of thought you know I should you know it takes some time especially because I
have the time after Karuna you just write a few blog post and reduce my sort of you know content creation on other channels and sort of focus on the blog that's something that I wanted to do and it aligns with my goal of you know being recognized as a good engineer so again going back to my very tips so so that's good things that come out of these difficulties so the abstract means away wait you know that's that's all you know a good good way to think about it it's more about you know how do you perceive
situations and less about you know a life hack in that sense so I don't know why I don't really believe in these sort of life hacks it's a very long-term thing that you do mostly right so no I'm a single there's no shortcuts to success rate six you think about it in terms of decades or at least cured right so here I was going to add that you know it's very personal as well as what works for me might not you know necessarily work for somebody else I think it's it's a process where you iterate and so just
dig dig a little deeper about you know the deep hole thing that you shared in your slides as in here like how do you go about it if you know like if you can elaborate on that that's the question which came up in the chat as well any ritual regarding deep work anything you know I I don't have any specific rituals in deep work honestly I just read the Cal Newport book around a month ago and I'm still trying to apply those lessons so what I do right now is I have this ad called for at forest to RESP forest so and it's
sort of interesting app in the sense you know when you press the button for say 20 minutes or so and we complete it what we comes out you know watch Wilky and then if you interrupt the process in between you have a dead tree so I don't want dead tree in so sorry make focus on it but more than that I think I mean that's maybe like a way to get started you know if you want some focus but what can be done for me at least this one thing that kind of work in between was to reduce my consumption habits right so
I think the Julia Roberts sorry the Judy which in your book also actually says this in terms of videos in content consumption they have this exercise called reading deprivation but for a week you sort of go without reading anything right so and I'm reader you know I read a lot of books and so that was interesting because if you reduce the amount of things that you consume social networking etc right then you naturally become slightly more common and I think that helps so but yeah this is very early days when the in terms of
excluding deep work and stuff so I'm not sure if it's completely for me because sometimes also I feel that some things you really need to have a bit of distraction and a bit of serendipity in your life and stuff because a lot of my ideas actually come from browsing Twitter in rate or github so I'm not sure I completely want to cut off everything right so in the book for example you can you port is almost like no more Omega liquor oh my dear in some way so I don't know if I want to go you know to that extent but it helps you
know it helps because most of the time you you can't distract it very easily when you're programming and that's not helpful so no I think from one benefit that I got from reading that book is now like I have like some vocabulary to you know measure like you know like to kind of figure out okay you know whatever work am i doing is it actually you know deep so that question in itself you know things in a lot of change you don't necessarily you know need to like go very deep into it and measure
you know those times and you know figure out processes let me put it but I feel you know just having that concept in your head allows you to think very differently about work because like the work that we're doing is actually you know very very new it's only like you know Industrial Age was then on all this while it's only you know last ten years or twenty years that you know like suddenly we we are all knowledge workers I'm still figuring this out so yeah next question is I would say quick one the
questions that you showed in your slide are they from the book eighteen steps - oh yeah you know they are from the book I think it's one of the first exercises that's said on a book probably in the first ten fifteen pages or so the book itself is also really small so if you are against trading in self-help books you know this is probably one of the easiest things to read so but yeah I mean like in like every book you know you kind of take what applies to you and discard the rest right so sometimes you
might not get the right frame of mind all right point in your life you know maybe you know the author's experience you think you don't apply to you so you know don't think into books as sacred think of books for the information so they are from the book but I perceive is you know feel it work for me and it's worth trying out so if it works real good will you share the slides and so I think the finishing up on time like we have ten more minutes left and it seems like we have you know the questions that
under the remaining ones any any particular questions that you you know feel is interesting and maybe you know you can devote the last ten minutes to a couple of questions from yeah maybe I can talk about this learning design system sometimes people junior developers to join in the companies I'm not sure they are you know so I don't think it should be worried about design systems and so on having a broad knowledge is obviously nice right so so one of the things which I found recently which which I think provides
some structure to what we can learn is this site called road map dot I said so maybe I can just share that you're right it's a bunch of these things which there is a road map for a front-end developer there's a road map for a back-end developers over for DevOps and so on so and it's it's a very broad sort of roadmap right so follow this advice to make a t-shape individual right so you first have a tee and then you go to W and so on but you start with the teeth figure out what your focus area is so it
could be react for example like like for me right now one of my focus areas is react right so but then you know you really need to know a broad array of the landscape as well so if you ask me is learning design systems compulsory probably not but is a knowledge of design systems good you know it's definitely panthulu that is yes so I've become broad knowledge everything is good and maybe focusing on a few areas is also really nice to join any company it's not just joining become nature and any company
me any other question that you so interesting do remote interview screening happen based on years of experience or what they can bring to the table I think it's mostly the latter what you can bring to the table it just so happens that sometimes no companies look for people who have experience working in the particular area or you know working in a particular technology right so in that sense it is it's probably more focused in that way right people who have experience probably get a little bit more weighted right so but
you know you should manage shy away from applying right so that mean to apply and talk about your experience and one way to build experience if you are young is is to work on open source projects right so if somebody asks you do you have experience in designing systems you can say you know yes I contributed to the WordPress design system right no that's probably a good good answer then people can ask you what did you do and then you can talk about all your open source contributions because it's all available
in public and people can take a look at that and figure out that you're actually good in that area right so so there's no there is a good substitute right now for experience and that is working in open source especially if you're a developer and I think you know the things I recently came across a tweet by Sahil who's the founder of come Road so he said that you know like like he is kind of you know figured out the process when he gives like our take home like like he asked the prospective candidates to work
on something which is actually you know part of the companies thing and it's like a paid kind of internship of sorts and that is essentially where you know the figure whether they are good fit for each other so I think we're still very early into this you know like interview process I certainly believe that you know whiteboard interviews you know though they you know have some value like I'm not saying that you know they don't add any value but I certainly believe that things are going to surely change a much
more interesting way I will judge how whether you can actually add value by working together yeah yes like that's an area where I feel kind of very strongly about as well so it is I think most of the hiring that has been done is based on something called any questions and what ends up happening after you you know get hired is you work on no algorithms at all right or very badly so in my career probably I've worked on it a handful of times right so where is that some entire focus of most of the interviews so in that sense I think the
take-home test is here to stay the only problem with the take-home test is it requires a lot of investment from the company so if you are a hiring company then you know you really need to evaluate all of these submissions well and if you are respectful to candidates they need to provide some feedback as well candidates who have been rejected it's a very costly process you know it's not as simple as you know sending them AHA currently that's it's so simple right so so in that sense it is a lot
more work but you know if you want the best candidates probably that's right way to do it and at the same time you know if you are the sort of person who doesn't like Al Gore only interviews like me you know you wouldn't even go to search so so I think we can finish off with this question as in life you mentioned a lot of books tearing this this whole conversation so see what he is trying to you know understand whether you you know how do you you know keep a track of all these learnings do you keep a track first of all and how
do you remember you utilize the lessons learned it's a very very general question it's not necessarily related to having like a solid remote career but but again like this came up a lot of times right yeah I do have a lot of notes which I put in Kindle in the sense I mostly read electronically no I do still buy books but most of my reading is on the table so I make a lot of highlight notes and stuff like that so that's I don't really go back to those notes so that's something I probably should do but I don't go back to any of
those notes something which I want to try out in my life you know I put them I've started recently using kid waste I I wasn't using to do it before honestly you know before I would for a join duyst but I started recently using to do inst earlier I used to put them on Apple notes you know else to do boxes so these are sort of personal things and I want to try out like for example a bunch of observations action items that I got from reading a deep work book put to do items and introduced I you know sort of put them
sort of new date on it and like for example it could be things like trying out making sure that I have a schedule which prioritizes deep work and reduces my internet usage so that's one all suggestions in the book it's hard to sort of structure your day that way but I really want to try it out for maybe like a week or so so as to figure out if there is some value in it right so I cannot have an action I'd someday so yeah I track my action items but I don't really track the cut my highlights and
notes and stuff right so that's too and most of my reading is is not you know nonfiction it's fiction actually I do read a lot of science fiction and fantasy and stuff so I mostly read it to relax so in that sense I should definitely share some of your favorite science fiction books and I shared a tool in chat I think this might be useful for you this is which helps you do resurface all of your kindle highlights so what it does it source although you know input all your Kindle highlights and every day to you know
show up like five highlights you can decide like in the number of highlights something and yeah this is something which means has been adding a lot of value to my life and maybe you know this this could be useful for the rest of yeah I think obviously there are more questions but I feel you know we can we can never gonna finish like tackling all of all of the questions that are possible but what we can do promise is you know you can take them offline you can you know take them asynchronously I can I can use the term here so this
was a great interview I think I think I enjoyed it a lot so guys if you can just you know share a note in the chart like how did you like this format did you find any value out of this conversation yeah enjoy this Thank You Bishop for organizing this and giving me an opportunity to speak as well it's nice to see a lot of people in the remote engine crowd well great very nice awesome I think any closing thoughts as in this I think finish yeah so I think for for people who are looking for a job you know I think stay at it you know I
think remote is definitely gonna gonna be the future right so I think that this pretty obvious now for everybody and I think I wish all if you like a lot of success and all of happiness and you know get what you want right so that's what you want thank you awesome thanks so we'll end on that note and yeah guys thanks for you know being there till the end of the conversation and talk to you soon have a great weekend
